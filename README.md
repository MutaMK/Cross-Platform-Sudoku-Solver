# Cross-Platform-Sudoku-Solver
A GUI that is for all platforms that solve sudoku puzzles. Utilized C++ and wxWidgets library
# Version: 
wxWidgets 3.1.4
# Note:
This source files do not contain the wxWidgets (3.1.4) library. To run this code 
you will need to install wxWidgets as well as add enviroment variables "WXWIN" to be the file
where wxWidgets is installled or you will need to add additional include directories and
library directories manually.
I have also added the visual basic class files for windows if you would like to run it as I have.
